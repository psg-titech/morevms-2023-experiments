# HPS Image
We used the SD card image provided by Terasic.  
Then we installed .NET Core 3.1.  

# HPS program
## Preparation
Copy FPGA_design/hsp_program/latencyMeasure to the SD card.  

## Building
Build via `dotnet` command.
```sh
$ cd $latencyMeasure
$ dotnet build -c Release
```

# FPGA Design
The design is available on FPGA_design/LatencyMeasure  
It is compiled with Quartus 16.1 Lite Edition on Windows.  
 1. Open LatencyMeasure.qpf (It is a project file.)  
 2. Open LatencyMeasure.qsys and generate Verilog HDL file by QSys (Platform Designer).  
 3. Then synthesis by Quartus and program it to the FPGA by Programmer.

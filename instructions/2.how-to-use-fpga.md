After preparing the SD card and programming the FPGA design to the FPGA, we can now measure latencies.

# Usage of HPS Program
```sh
$ dotnet run -c Release -- <output_file_name.dat> <times_to_sample>
```

# The Data Structure
The output file structure is:

```c
int data[times_to_sample];
```

The unit of `data` is 20[ns].
